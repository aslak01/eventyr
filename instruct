in this directory, the /chapters directory contains a directory named after each of the   │
│   fairy tales of this brothers grimm collection, and in that directory is a file names for  │
│   the fairy tale in txt format. That file contains the raw scanned pdf to txt conversion    │
│   that a library has done en masse, meaning there are a bunch of ortographical mistakes,    │
│   jumbled text. Please go through each txt, correct orthographical mistakes, and            │
│   reconstruct jumbled or out of place words. In some few cases it come passages may be so   │
│   jumbled, that it may be necessary to check other sources to reconstruct what they were    │
│   meant to say. Please do this, and also modernise the language from the archaic form of    │
│   Norwegian it was written in to a slightly more modern form. Then convert the resulting    │
│   text to markdown, and save it in the folder specific to that chapter as a markdown file.
